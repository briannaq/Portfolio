  <h4> ROLE </h4>

<p> The intent of this project is to explore typographic space with large quantities of text. Design influences the audience’s ability to read, understand and enjoy a piece of writing. By using the principles of hierarchy, alignment, and page layout, we practice using typographic space through four different solutions. Each solution follows a different set of criteria that affects how the reader would comprehend the text. We must take into account what we are trying to communicate through these solutions and to whom we are designing for. </p>

<p> With this assignment I chose to redesign The Beatles vinyl album track list. As a result,  a bounded magazine is presented to demonstrate our understanding of typographic space and magazine production. </p>

<p class="description"> The ideation process began with several hand-drawn sketches of different layout possibilities. I then continued to explore and ideate more designs through digital roughs and mockups. </p>

<h2 class="work-subtitle"> Art Direction </h2>

<div class="art-content">

<div class="description">
<p>Since I chose The Beatles as my topic for this assignment, I wanted the overall theme of my magazine to have a more modern style whilst also keeping a bit of the 60’s and 70’s vibe. I was inspired by their “Yellow Submarine” album cover due to its use of bright colours and unique shapes. I wanted to incorporate this into the cover to retain some of their art direction while also contrasting it to the more modern approach of my solutions and interior. </p>

<div class="design-rationale process-section">
  <h2 class="work-subtitle"> Design Rationale </h2>
  <p class="description">For my solutions, the main point I wanted to focus on was establishing clear reading hierarchy, readability, and legibility. I achieved this through using white space as it helped create flow and guidance for the readers. To guide the reader’s eyes through the composition, I isolated clusters that should be viewed first as well as utilized lines and shapes. I also decided to use colour within my solutions to create contrast while also keeping the theme of my overall magazine. In comparison to black and white, the colour helped the composition feel less flat and static, allowing for more contrast between the text. Using typographic elements such as lines helped balance the color out and assist with readability. </p>
